## Proposal

A Markov chain is a model that tells us something about the probabilities of sequences of random variables,
states, each of which can take on values from some set (Jurafsky & Martin, 2020). A Hidden Markov Model, or HMM, is a generalization of a Markov chain and allows for analysis on both observed and hidden states (Fonzo et al, 2007). HMMs have a wide variety of applications in the Bioinformatics field. Some prominent applications include: alignment, profiling of sequences, protein structure prediction, and pattern recognition. We propose to (TODO: finish up proposal)
